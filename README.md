# Number Guessing Game Project

- Includes two players, a user and a computer.
- both the user and computer choose a random number and the game determines who wins depending on who guesses the number.
- once the winner is determined for the round, then the next round, so on and so forth.

## the winner is determined based on two factors :

- the user/computer guesses the exact number of the round.
- the user/computer guesses the number closest to what the actual number is.
